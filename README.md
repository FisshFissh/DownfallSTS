Character Bosses Rework - All 15 affected.

While novel, the Character Bosses have always suffered from being a bit more complex than they need to be. While observing new players, the behavior has typically always been "Oh my god, they use the character's cards!" and often end the discovery there. Some players will go "oh, they also have relics" with less excitement, and most don't pay attention to the special mechanics UI or the initial buff powers at all at first glance. It became clear quickly that three new places to look at, hover, and read in order to fully understand a fight was too much - but changing the Bosses fundamentally at their core to fix that would require a lot of work, tuning and time. Since the bosses playing cards are what stands out and is exciting, this update focuses the gameplay exclusively on that aspect.

When designing the Bosses turns, historically we've put ourselves in too small of a design box by trying to simulate an actual deck, meaning at some point the cards cycle on "shuffle" and no Powers or Exhaust cards that were used are present after the "shuffle". This has exception cases written, which somewhat defeats the point, and also makes it difficult to scale fights effectively since Powers can't repeat. It also has made many "silly" turns where we add curses, statuses, or very weak cards just to fill the holes because its what the "design box" demands. This "design box" has also made it historically difficult to change and balance these fights because we can't simply add or remove cards, we also have to factor in energy, simulated draw, "shuffle" loops.

With those comments in mind, bosses have been redesigned all with the following changes:

 
 
-Bosses no longer have an energy limit. They play every card shown in intents.

-Bosses no longer have consistent number of cards per turn. They may play 1, 2, or 3 cards, whatever the design and balance calls for.

-Bosses no longer have relics.

-Bosses no longer have a forced special character mechanic. Instead, most bosses that utilize special mechanics will follow in Mushroom Ironclad's footsteps and have a new unique Power card that explains the effect, and they play that card on turn 1.

 
 

Most character bosses have retained their general theme and mechanics, with a few changes:

Ironclad 1 - Still places its generated Status cards in your piles.

Silent 1 - Still is themed around Poison, Poison mechanics unchanged.

Defect 1 - Now places Voids when dealing unblocked attack damage. Infrequently attacks, but attacks hard, and still has a countdown clock from Darkness orbs.

Watcher 1 - Fully reworked. Now tracks your Attacks and Skills, and switches stances based on which one is used more.

Hermit 1 - Still is based on Dead On and breaking concentration, mechanics unchanged.

Ironclad 2 - Mechanics unchanged, still is Mushroom / Healing themed.

Silent 2 - Mechanics unchanged, still has the Illusory Silent.

Defect 2 - Mechanics unchanged, still has Bronze Orb and Artifact abuse.

Watcher 2 - Fully reworked, now is a purely Defensive setup that opens with Alpha, and has a Cultist buddy.

Hermit 2 - Mechanics unchanged, still uses the Wheel of cards, but many new cards have been added and Hermit will open the fight with Determination as his method of scaling.

Ironclad 3 - Mechanics unchanged, still is Block themed with the Fortification.

Silent 3 - Mechanics unchanged, still uses Shivs and hinders 2+ cost cards.

Defect 3 - Mechanics unchanged, still uses Orbs and hinders Powers.

Watcher 3 - Returned to being Mantra-themed and hinders mass-play combo decks.

Hermit 3 - Partially reworked, now is a Strike/Defend Maintenance deck that still summons Daggers.
